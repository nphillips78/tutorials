# How to make a tutorial request

Check [issues](https://github.com/remarkablemark/tutorials/issues) first to see if the tutorial has already been requested. If it has, then you may leave a comment or an emoji.

If you cannot find the tutorial, then feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/remarkablemark/tutorials/issues/new) like so:

```
Title: [Subject] Short description

Explain in the body why the tutorial is useful, what it should cover, and any additional information or links.
```

Here's an example:

```
Title: [React] Server-side rendering

What are the benefits of server-side rendering? How do I set it up with Node.js + Express?
Documentation: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html
```

If I do accept the tutorial request, then I will create a **video** and/or **written** tutorial.

### Note

**Please do some research before requesting a tutorial.**

I ask this because someone else may have already created an excellent tutorial on the topic. Let's do our best to minimize redundancy and inefficency. Being proactive is a big plus and by making my life easier, you will enable me to complete the tutorials faster.

**Please keep the tutorial as modular as possible.**

This takes advantage of _componentization_, which allows each tutorial to be its own _Lego piece_. The benefits are threefold:

1. each tutorial can be a **building block** for other tutorials,
2. each tutorial can be **swapped** with another tutorial when the content becomes outdated,
3. each tutorial covers only the **necessary amount of material** in order to minimize complexity and bloat.

This philosophy is influenced by [industrial design and architecture](http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=7e093c5cf4&id=ead8a72012&e=ecb25a3f93) (see [modularity](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity)).

### Disclaimer

Although I will try my best to be responsive, **I cannot guarantee that I am able to fulfill every request**. This is because I'm only one person and I have many responsibilities. I will also prioritize requests based on my interests as well as other factors. I'm open to any help provided!
