# How to make a tutorial request

Check [issues](https://github.com/remarkablemark/tutorials/issues) first to see if the tutorial has already been requested. If it has, then you may leave a comment or an emoji.

If you cannot find the tutorial, then feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/remarkablemark/tutorials/issues/new) like so:

```
Title: [Subject] Short description

Explain in the body why the tutorial is useful, what it should cover, and any additional information or links.
```

Here's an example:

```
Title: [React] Server-side rendering

What are the benefits of server-side rendering? How do I set it up with Node.js + Express?
Documentation: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html
```

If I do accept the tutorial request, then I will create a **video** and/or **written** tutorial.

### Note

_Please do some research before requesting a tutorial._

I ask this because someone else may have already created an excellent tutorial on the topic. Let's do our best to minimize redundancy and inefficency. Being proactive is a big plus and by making my life easier, you will enable me to complete the tutorials faster.

### Disclaimer

Although I will try my best to be responsive, **I cannot guarantee that I am able to fulfill every request**. This is because I'm only one person and I have many responsibilities. I will also prioritize requests based on my interests as well as other factors. If you'd like to help, I'm very open to that!
